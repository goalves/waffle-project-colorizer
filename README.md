# Waffle Project Colorizer
Chrome Extension to add colors to different projects that are being represented in a single waffle.io board.

## How to install:
To install you need to go through these steps:
1. Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/goalves/waffle-project-colorizer/releases "WPC-Releases") section of this repository.
2. Open chrome extensions settings (chrome://extensions/) and just drag and drop the `waffle-project-colorizer.cxr` file.

## How to use:
Currently this version automatically starts working once you open a board in Waffle.
It is still possible to change the color of all cards clicking in the painting palette added to your other chrome extensions.

## Reminders:
This project is still in its initial development stage. :)
